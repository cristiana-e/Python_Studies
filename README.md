# Hello, fellow adventures! :woman_astronaut: 

###  Welcome to my GitHub repository! 

I created this repo to share with you my studies of Python programming language! :snake:

Most of the descriptions of the exercises written are in the Brazilian Portuguese language! 

:notebook: Feel free to use it in your studies! :notebook:

*The instructor name/school/channel/site from where I took the exercises will be at the end of the file.*

Join me on this new travel!

Commander Crispy over and out. :wave:
